# FAQ Chatbot ðŸ¤– using Scraped Website Data from the University of Stirling ðŸš€

## Introduction

This project presents a user-friendly FAQ chatbot that addresses frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to your university. It leverages web scraping techniques to gather relevant information from the university's website and utilizes powerful NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools to answer user queries in a conversational manner.

## Project Goals

- Enhance user experience by providing a convenient and readily accessible way to find university-related information.
- Demonstrate web scraping and NLP skills using Python libraries.
- Build a Streamlit application for a user-friendly interface.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The foundational programming language for the entire project.
- **Beautiful Soup**: To efficiently extract FAQ data from the university website.
- **LangChain**: A comprehensive NLP library for text processing, document management, and chatbot development.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database for efficient text retrieval and search.
- **OpenAI**: A large language model (LLM) for generating human-quality responses if additional conversational fluency is desired.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating interactive web apps to present the chatbot interface.
